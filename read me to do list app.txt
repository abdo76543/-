This is a simple **To-Do List** application built with **React** for the front-end and **Node.js** for the back-end. The application allows users to add, display, and delete tasks from a to-do list.

## Features

- Add new tasks.
- View all tasks.
- Delete tasks from the list.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: In-memory (No database used in this example)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need to have **Node.js** installed on your machine.

1. **Install Node.js**:
   - Download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - In the project directory, run:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

### Running the Application

1. **Backend (Node.js)**:
   - Navigate to the server directory and start the Node.js server:
     ```bash
     node server.js
     ```
   - The server will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **Frontend (React)**:
   - Navigate to the React app directory and install the dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Then run the React development server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - The React app will be available at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

### API Endpoints

- `GET /tasks`: Retrieve all tasks.
- `POST /tasks`: Add a new task to the list.
- `DELETE /tasks/:id`: Delete a task by its ID.

## Project Structure


- `/client` contains the React code responsible for the front-end.
- `/server` contains the Node.js code responsible for handling requests and managing the task data.
